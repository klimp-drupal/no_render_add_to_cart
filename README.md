# no_render_add_to_cart

The module provides an "Add to cart" form which is not based on Drupal Form API. Regular Drupal Commerce "Add to cart" form takes time to be rendered, thus it might bring about a strain on performance. This module allows to avoid such a behaviour and decrease page loading time.

Includes:
 - an extra field being displayed along with the whole Commerce product entity;
 - Views field handler.
